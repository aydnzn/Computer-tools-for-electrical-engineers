function [ X ] = solution_matrix(n,k )
% Task5-create solution matrix X
% (n+k)x1 matrix holding the unknown quantities
% node voltages and the currents through the independent voltage sources
% the top n elements are the n node voltages.
% the bottom k elements represent the currents through the m independent voltage sources 
X = zeros(n+k,1);
